FairLens is an open source Python library for automatically discovering bias and measuring fairness in data. The package can be used to quickly identify bias, and provides multiple metrics to measure fairness across a range of sensitive and legally protected characteristics such as age, race and sex.

The goal of FairLens is to enable data scientists to gain a deeper understanding of their data, and helps to to ensure fair and ethical use of data in analysis and machine learning tasks. The insights gained from FairLens can be harnessed by the [Bias Mitigation](https://www.synthesized.io/post/synthesized-mitigates-bias-in-data) feature of the [Synthesized](https://synthesized.io) platform, which is able to automagically remove bias using the power of synthetic data.

See some of our previous blog posts for our take on bias and fairness in ML:
