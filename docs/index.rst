FairLens
========

FairLens is an open source Python library for automatically discovering bias and measuring fairness in data.
The package can be used to quickly identify bias, and provides multiple metrics to measure fairness across a
range of sensitive and legally protected characteristics such as age, race and sex.


Project background
==================

The rapid adoption of the data-driven approach and machine learning by businesses across the board has sparked a large amount of
interest from legal authorities and motivated recent legislation on the topic of fairness and bias in machine learning.
There is a substantial amount of evidence of various occurrences of discrimintation, including biases in recommender systems,
biases in predictive policing algorithms, and biases in risk assessment.
