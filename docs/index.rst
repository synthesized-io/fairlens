FairLens is a tool to help people assess the fairness of datasets and models in machine learning.


.. FairLens is a library that can be used to identify and measure various kinds of biases in structural data.
.. This package can be used to examine and create reports on the quality of a dataset in the
.. context of fairness. With legislation around the use of legally protected attributes
.. becoming more stringent, this package can help identify potential red flags in datasets
.. before models are trained on them. While FairLens was built with data centric fairness in mind,
.. users may find some metrics useful for model centric approaches involving altered
.. loss functions or regularization [1, 2].
