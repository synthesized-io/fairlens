========

FairLens is an open source Python library for automatically discovering bias and measuring fairness in data. The package can be used to quickly identify bias, and provides multiple metrics to measure fairness across a range of sensitive and legally protected characteristics such as age, race and sex.


Project background
==================

The rapid adoption of the data-driven approach and machine learning by businesses across a variety of industries, has motivated
recent legislation on the topic of fairness and bias in machine learning and sparked a large amount of interest in the field.
A substantial amount of evidence has started to emerge of various occurrences of discrimintation, including biases
in recommender systems, biases in predictive policing algorithms, and biases in risk assessment.


FairLens is targeted
