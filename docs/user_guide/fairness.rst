Types of Biases
---------------

Some of the predominant causes of unfairness resulting from structural datasets are highlighted in the
works of Kamishima et al. on a regularization approach to fairness in models [1]. In summary, the
following are ways in which biases can exist in structural data.

Prejudice
^^^^^^^^^

Prejudice occurs when the target column in a dataset, or any column used in a prediction model, is
dependant on a sensitive column. There are three types of prejudice.

.. * Direct prejudice occurs when a sensitive column is directly used in a prediction model thereforex

Underestimation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Negative Legacy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
